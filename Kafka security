Encryption of data using SSL / TLS: uses both asymmetric and symmetric encryption to protect the
confidentiality and integrity of data-in-transit. Asymmetric encryption is used to establish a secure
session between a client and a server, and symmetric encryption is used to exchange data within the
secured session.​

Authentication using SSL or SASL: (Simple Authentication and Security Layer,) is a framework that
provides a standard interface for authentication protocols. It is designed to decouple authentication
mechanisms from application protocols, allowing various authentication mechanisms to be used with
different applications ​

Authorization using ACLs: Access Control List, is a security feature in Apache Kafka that allows
administrators to control and restrict access to Kafka resources. ACLs help enforce authorization
policies by specifying what actions different users or client applications are allowed to perform on
Kafka topics.​

Kafka supports the following SASL mechanisms: ​

SASL/GSSAPI (Kerberos) - starting at version 0.9.0.0​
SASL/PLAIN - starting at version 0.10.0.0​
SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256 and SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512 - starting at version 0.10.2.0​
SASL/OAUTHBEARER - starting at version 2.0​
