# Client:
The client initiates communication by requesting access to a service on behalf of the user. It acts as the user's agent in the authentication process.

# Server:
This is the host offering the network service the user wants to access. It relies on Kerberos authentication to validate access requests.

# Authentication Server (AS):
The AS verifies the identity of users during initial login. Upon successful authentication, it issues a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which the client can later use to request access to services without re-authenticating.

# Key Distribution Center (KDC):
The KDC is the central component of the Kerberos protocol. It combines three logical entities:

# Database – stores user and service credentials.

# Authentication Server (AS) – handles initial user authentication and TGT issuance.

# Ticket Granting Server (TGS) – issues service tickets based on the TGT.
These components operate on a single physical server referred to as the Key Distribution Center.

# Ticket Granting Server (TGS):
The TGS issues service tickets based on a valid TGT. These tickets allow the client to access specific services securely, without needing to re-authenticate each time.
