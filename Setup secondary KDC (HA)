# Install the required packages
First, install the packages, and when asked for the Kerberos and Admin server names enter the name of the Primary KDC:

Configure replica KDCs​
Note: When installing a replica KDC, the hostname and admin server name should match those of the master KDC.​
Database propagation copies the contents of the primary database but does not propagate configuration files, ​
stash files, or the kadm5 ACL file. The following files must be copied by hand to each replica                       ​
krb5.conf​
kdc.conf​
kadm5.acl​
master key stash file​

Once you have installed the packages, create the host principals for both KDCs. ​

$ kadmin -q "addprinc -randkey host/kdc1.example.com"​
$ kadmin -q "addprinc -randkey host/kdc2.example.com"​
​
Extract the key file for the kdc2 principal, from the replica server (kdc): ​
$ sudo kadmin -p ubuntu/admin -q "ktadd host/kdc2.example.com"​
